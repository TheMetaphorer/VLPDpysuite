400,Electric utility service; advances scheduled expiration of capped rate period.,https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?071+ful+HB3068,2007,Energy,"SUMMARY AS ENACTED WITH GOVERNOR'S RECOMMENDATION: Electric utility regulation. Advances the scheduled  expiration of the capped rate period from December 31, 2010, to December 31,  2008, establishes a new mechanism for regulating the rates of investor-owned  electric utilities, and limits the ability of most consumers to purchase  electric generation service from competing suppliers. The ratemaking procedure  requires the State Corporation Commission (SCC) to conduct a rate case for  investor-owned utilities in 2009; thereafter, the SCC will review each  utility's rates, terms, and conditions using two 12-month test periods ending  December 31, 2010, though the SCC is given discretion to stagger the years in  which it conducts such reviews.  In these biennial reviews the SCC will  determine fair rates of return on common equity for the utility's generation  and distribution services, using any methodology it finds consistent with the  public interest.  However, the return shall not be set: (i) lower than the  average of the returns on common equity reported to the Securities and Exchange  Commission for the three most recent annual periods by a peer group of a  majority of the other vertically-integrated investor-owned electric utilities  in the southeastern United States with a Moody's bond rating of at least Baa or  (ii) higher than 300 basis points above that average.  Increases in the rate of  return are capped based on the rate of increases in the Consumer Price Index  (CPI). The SCC may increase or decrease the rate of return by a Performance  Incentive of up to 100 basis points based on the generating plant performance,  customer service, operations and efficiency of a utility. In setting the return  on equity, the SCC is required to strive to maintain costs of retail electric  energy that are cost competitive with costs of retail electric energy provided  by the other peer group investor-owned electric utilities. If the combined rate  of return on common equity earned is no more than one half of one percent above  or below this rate of return, the return shall not be considered either  excessive or insufficient. Each utility may seek rate adjustment clauses to  recover (i) costs for transmission services provided by PJM Interconnection  under applicable rates, terms and conditions approved by the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission (FERC) and costs of FERC-approved demand response programs;  (ii) deferred environmental and reliability costs authorized under prior capped  rate rules; (iii) costs of providing incentives for the utility to design and  operate fair and effective demand-management, conservation, energy efficiency,  and load management programs; (iv) costs of participation in the new renewable  energy portfolio standard program; and (v) costs of projects that the SCC finds  to be necessary to comply with state or federal environmental laws or  regulations applicable to generation facilities used to serve the utilitys  native load obligations, which costs may include the enhanced rate of return  for new base load generation if the project would reduce the need for  construction of new generation facilities by enabling the continued operation  of existing generation facilities. A utility may also apply a rate adjustment  clause for recovery from customers of the costs of (i) a coal-fired generation  facility that utilizes Virginia coal and is located in the coalfield region of  the Commonwealth, (ii) one or more other generation facilities, or (iii) one or  more major unit modifications of generation facilities, to meet the utilitys  projected native load obligations. The utility may recover an enhanced rate of  return on common equity associated with the type of project, which may include  projects utilizing nuclear power, renewable technologies, carbon capture  facilities, combined cycle combustion turbines, and conventional coal  facilities. The period over which the enhanced rate of return may be collected  depends on the type of facility, as determined by the SCC within specified  ranges. The SCCs final order on any petition filed for any of the rate  adjustment clauses shall be entered within a specified period after the filing  of the petition, and any rate increase required by the clause shall go into  effect within 60 days or upon the end of capped rates, whichever is later. The SCC  is required to consider petitions for rate adjustment clauses on a stand-alone  basis, without regard to the other costs or revenues of the utility. The  enhanced returns are subject to revocation if permits are not applied for or  construction is not commenced by specified dates. If the SCC determines in a  biennial review that a utility underearned by at least 50 basis points on its  generation and distribution services, excluding provisions for new generation  facilities, the SCC is required to increase the utilitys rates to a level  necessary to provide the opportunity to fully recover the costs of providing  the utilitys services and to earn such fair rate of return. If the SCC  determines in a biennial review that a utility earned more than 50 basis points  above a fair combined rate of return on its generation and distribution  services, excluding provisions for new generation facilities, the SCC is  required to direct that 60 percent of such overearnings be credited to  customers' bills over a period of between 6 and 12 months, to be determined by  the SCC. In addition, if the SCC determines that the utility's earnings exceed  this limit for two consecutive biennial review periods, it shall also order  reductions to the utilitys rates, provided that rates may not be reduced to  levels below what would provide the utility with the opportunity to fully  recover its costs and to earn a fair combined rate of return on its generation  and distribution services, excluding provisions for new generation facilities.  If the Commission determines that and the utility's total aggregate regulated  rates would exceed the annual increases in CPI, when compared to the utility's  rates as determined in the biennial review for a base period (either the  utility's first test period or the most recent test period for which credits  are applied to customers' bills), the Commission shall direct, unless such action  would not be in the public interest, that any or all of such overearnings be  credited to customers' bills. An electric utility that demonstrates that it has  a reasonable expectation of achieving 12 percent of its base year electric  energy sales from certain renewable energy sources during calendar year 2022  may participate in a renewable energy portfolio standard program. Under the  program, a participating utility that meets specified percentage goals for  sales of eligible renewable energy is eligible for a Performance Incentive that  increases the fair combined rate of return on common equity for the utility by  a 50 basis points through the third succeeding biennial review if it continues  to meet the RPS Goals. It is also entitled to an enhanced rate of return on the  costs associated with the construction of renewable energy generation  facilities used to provide the renewable energy. Participating utilities may  recover their incremental costs of meeting the RPS Goals from customers other  than large industrial customers purchasing electricity at large general service  rates and at primary or transmission voltage. Double credits will be provided  for energy from solar or wind sources. Specific provisions address the use of  certain wood products for projects qualifying to meet the renewable energy  goals. With regard to the ability of customers to purchase generation services  from competing providers, the measure provides that after the capped rate  period ends, only customers whose annual demand exceeds five megawatts will be  permitted to shop.  However, two or more individual nonresidential retail  customers may aggregate their demand for the purpose of meeting the five  megawatt threshold if the Commission finds that neither their incumbent  electric utility nor its retail customers will be adversely affected and that  the demand of the customers who are allowed to buy power from competitors will  not exceed one percent of the utilitys peak annual load.  Aggregating  customers may petition the SCC to aggregate their supply, even if their  aggregated load exceeds 1% of the utilitys demand, if the aggregation would  not harm other utility customers or the utility. The ability of large customers  to purchase electric power from a licensed competitive supplier is subject to the  condition that they cannot thereafter purchase electricity from their incumbent  utility without giving 5 years notice, with certain exceptions; however, the  5-year notice requirement does not apply if the SCC finds that waiving it would  not harm other utility customers or the utility. Municipalities are allowed to  aggregate the electric energy load of their governmental operations for the  purpose of negotiating rates and terms, and conditions of service from the  electric utility certificated by the Commission to serve the territory in which  such operations are located. Other provisions (i) require the deferral over the  period 2008-2010 of a portion of Dominion's 2007 fuel factor increase; (ii)  authorize electric utilities to seek approval of optional performance-based  regulation methodologies to the same extent as gas utilities; (iii) require  that 75 percent of the margins from off-system sales be applied to the  utility's fuel expenses unless the SCC finds by clear and convincing evidence  that a smaller percentage is in the public interest; (iv) require rates of  distribution electric cooperatives to be regulated pursuant to the provisions  of Chapters 9.1 and 10 of Title 56, subject to the ability to increase rates  without SCC approval by not more than five percent over three years and to make  certain other changes to terms and conditions of service; (v) provide that the  measure does not modify or impair the terms, unless otherwise modified by an  order of the SCC, of any SCC order approving the divestiture of generation  assets; (vi) direct the SCC to complete by December 15, 2007, a proceeding to develop  a plan to identify and implement demand side management, conservation, energy  efficiency, load management, real-time pricing, and consumer education programs  in order to achieve by 2022 a stated goal of reducing the consumption of  electric energy by retail customers by ten percent of the amount consumed by  such customers in 2006; (vii) direct the Office of the Attorney General to  identify issues of the act that impede its implementation; (viii) direct the  Department of Taxation is directed to conduct an analysis of the potential  implications of the provisions of this measure on the system of taxation; (ix)  ensure that utilities use competitive bidding in purchasing and construction  practices; (x) increase the cap on power that a utility may be required to  purchase from eligible customer-generators under the net energy metering  program from 0.1% to one percent of the utility's adjusted peal load; and (xi)  allow competitive service providers to offer 100% renewable power to retail  customers in any area of the Commonwealth where the customer's incumbent  utility does not offer such a tariff. Provisions of the Electric Utility  Restructuring Act that exempt the generation of electric energy from  regulation, prohibit public service corporations from exercising the power of  eminent domain to acquire property for generation facilities, authorize the  collection of wires charges, and authorize competition for metering and billing  services are repealed. This bill is identical to SB 1416. SUMMARY AS PASSED: Electric utilities.

Provisions of the Electric Utility  Restructuring Act that exempt the generation of electric energy from  regulation, prohibit public service corporations from exercising the power of  eminent domain to acquire property for generation facilities, authorize the  collection of wires charges, and authorize competition for metering and billing  services are repealed. This bill is identical to SB 1416. SUMMARY AS PASSED HOUSE:  Regulation of electric utility service.  Advances  the scheduled expiration of the capped rate period from December 31, 2010, to  December 31, 2008, establishes a new mechanism for regulating the rates of investor-owned  electric utilities, and ends the ability of most consumers to shop for electric  generation service. The ratemaking procedure requires the State Corporation  Commission (SCC) to review each utility's rates, terms, and conditions using a  12-month test period ending December 31, 2008 (for utilities other than  Dominion) and the two successive 12-month test periods ending December 31, 2009  (for Dominion). Thereafter, the reviews will cover the two successive 12-month  test periods.  In these biennial reviews the SCC will determine fair rates  of return on common equity for the utility's generation and distribution  services, using any methodology it finds consistent with the public  interest.  However, the return shall not be set: (i) lower than the average  of the returns on common equity reported to the Securities and Exchange  Commission for the three most recent annual periods by a peer group of nine  other vertically-integrated investor-owned electric utilities in the  southeastern United States with a Moody's bond rating of at least Baa or (ii)  higher than the national average earned returns of vertically integrated,  regulated electric utilities granted during the most recent prior 12 months,  plus 200 basis points.  The Commission may increase or decrease the rate  of return by Performance Incentive of up to 50 basis points based on the  generating plant performance, customer service, operations and efficiency of a  utility. If the combined rate of return on common equity earned is no more than  one half of one percent above or below this rate of return, the return shall  not be considered either excessive or insufficient. Each utility may seek rate  adjustment clauses to recover (i) costs for transmission services provided by  PJM Interconnection under applicable rates, terms and conditions approved by  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and costs of FERC-approved  demand response programs; (ii) deferred environmental and reliability costs  authorized under prior capped rate rules; (iii) costs of providing incentives  for the utility to design and operate fair and effective demand-management,  conservation, energy efficiency, and load management programs; (iv) costs of  participation in the new renewable energy portfolio standard program; and (v)  costs of projects that the Commission finds to be necessary to comply with  state or federal environmental laws or regulations applicable to generation  facilities used to serve the utilitys native load obligations, which costs may  include the enhanced rate of return for new base load generation if the project  would reduce the need for construction of new generation facilities by enabling  the continued operation of existing generation facilities.  A utility may  also apply a rate adjustment clause for recovery from customers of the costs of  (i) a coal-fired generation facility that utilizes Virginia coal and is located  in the coalfield region of the Commonwealth, (ii) one or more other generation  facilities, or (iii) one or more major unit modifications of generation facilities,  to meet the utilitys projected native load obligations.  The utility may  recover an enhanced rate of return on common equity of between 50 and 400 basis  points, as determined by the Commission, on projects and facilities other than  simple-cycle combustion turbine facilities. This enhanced rate of return is  added in the utilitys investment in construction work in progress associated  with the facility and in plant in service during the first year of the service  life of the facility. The Commissions final order on any petition filed for  any of the rate adjustment clauses shall be entered within a specified period  after the filing of the petition, and any rate increase required by the clause  shall go into effect within 60 days or upon the end of capped rates, whichever  is later.  The Commission is required to consider petitions for rate  adjustment clauses on a stand-alone basis, without regard to the other costs or  revenues of the utility.  Costs incurred prior to the filing of a petition  for a rate adjustment clause, or during the petition's consideration, that  relate to recover of the deferred environmental and reliability costs or to new  generation facilities and projects (other than those using simple-cycle  combustion turbines) will be deferred until the later of Commissions final  order or the implementation of any rate adjustment clauses. This deferral  provision does not affect the rights of parties with respect to FERC proceeding  regarding Dominion's proposed deferral of its costs of joining PJM. If the  Commission determines in a biennial review that a utility earned at least 50  basis points less than a fair combined rate of return on its generation and  distribution services, excluding provisions for new generation facilities, the  Commission is required to increase the utilitys rates to a level necessary to  provide the opportunity to fully recover the costs of providing the utilitys  services and to earn such fair combined rate of return.  The most recent  12-month test period will be used in determining the amount of the rate  increase.  However, if this rate increase, when added to any increase  resulting from the enhanced return for generation facilities, from the recovery  of fuel and purchased power costs, and any other provision would exceed the  annual increases in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the period under review  plus two percentage points, the rate increase will be limited to that amount  unless the Commission finds, upon a review of all relevant information  regarding the overall costs and revenues of the utility, that a rate increase  that exceeds that amount would result in rates that are just and reasonable. If  the Commission determines in a biennial review that a utility earned more than  50 basis points above a fair combined rate of return on its generation and  distribution services, excluding provisions for new generation facilities, the  Commission is required to direct that 60 percent of such overearnings be  credited to customers' bills.  In addition, if the Commission determines  that (i) the utility's earnings exceed this limit for two consecutive biennial  review periods, the Commission shall also order reductions to the utilitys  rates, provided that rates may not be reduced to levels below what would  provide the utility with the opportunity to fully recover its costs and to earn  50 basis points above a fair combined rate of return on its generation and  distribution services, excluding provisions for new generation facilities and  (ii) the utility's total aggregate regulated rates, following a biennial  review, would exceed the annual increases in CPI, when compared to the  utility's rates as determined in the biennial review for a base period (either  the utility's first test period or the most recent test period for which  credits are applied to customers' bills), the Commission may direct that any or  all of such overearnings be credited to customers' bills, in lieu of any rate  reduction or other crediting. An electric utility that demonstrates that it has  a reasonable expectation of achieving 12 percent of its base year electric  energy sales from renewable energy sources during calendar year 2022 may  participate in a renewable energy portfolio standard program. Under the  program, a participating utility that meets specified percentage goals for  sales of renewable energy that is generated from generation facilities that are  owned and operated by the utility and constructed after July 1, 2007, is  eligible for either (i) a Performance Incentive that increases  the fair  combined rate of return on common equity for the utility by 50 basis points  through the third succeeding biennial review if it continues to meet the RPS  Goals or (ii) an enhanced rate of return, on the costs associated with the  construction of renewable energy generation facilities used to provide the  renewable energy. A participating utility may recover all incremental costs  incurred on or after July 1, 2007, of its participation. With regard to the  ability of customers to select purchase generation services from competing providers,  the measure provides that after the capped rate period ends, only customers  whose annual demand exceeds five megawatts will be permitted to shop. However,  two or more individual nonresidential retail customers may aggregate their  demand for the purpose of meeting the 5 megawatt threshold if the Commission  finds that neither their incumbent electric utility nor its retail customers  will be adversely affected and that the demand of the customers who are allowed  to buy power from competitors will not exceed one percent of the utilitys peak  annual load. The ability of large customers to purchase electric power from a  licensed competitive supplier is subject to the condition that they cannot  thereafter purchase electricity from their incumbent utility without giving 5  years notice, unless it demonstrates that the supplier failed to perform and  that such customer is unable to obtain service from an alternative supplier. If  a customer receives an exemption from the 5-year minimum stay requirement, the  cost of its power during the exemption period will be the market-based costs of  the utility. Municipalities are allowed to aggregating the electric energy load  of their governmental operations for the purpose of negotiating rates and  terms, and conditions of service from the electric utility certificated by the  Commission to serve the territory in which such operations are located.   Other provisions (i) require utilities to file plans for how they will meet  generation and transmission requirements to serve native load for the ensuing  10 years; (ii) authorize electric utilities to seek approval of optional  performance-based regulation methodologies to the same extent as gas utilities;  (iii) restore the requirement that the Commission find, before permitting the construction  and operation of an electrical generating facility, that the facility is  required by the public convenience and necessity; (iv) requires rates of  distribution electric cooperatives to be regulated pursuant to the provisions  of Chapters 9.1 and 10 of Title 56, except that cooperatives are not required  to adj"

Currently, decisions of the State Water Control Board are appealable only by  aggrieved owners.  The current test for standing to challenge permitting  decisions of the Air Pollution Control Board requires that the prospective  appellant has exhausted all administrative remedies and has suffered an  actual, threatened or imminent injury that is an invasion of a pecuniary and  substantial interest which is concrete and particularized."

Prevents title to federally owned property from reverting to  state ownership by operation of law if environmental hazards on the property  have not been remedied.  The Superfund law prohibits the federal government  from conveying property contaminated with hazardous substances to anyone  without cleaning up the property and requires that the deed contain covenants  to take further necessary remedial action.  Existing state law provides that  nonuse and other circumstances will cause an immediate reversion of federal  lands to the state.  By preventing title from passing to the Commonwealth  without the execution and delivery of a proper transfer instrument by the  federal government, this bill seeks to ensure that the protections in the  Superfund law are not circumvented.  The bill also provides that if the BRAC  Commission (Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission) identifies a  Virginia base for closure, the Commonwealth shall have the right to enter  upon such lands for inspection, and to report its findings to the Governor  and the appropriate federal agencies."

Under current law families have to give up custody of their  children to receive out-of-home services such as foster care.  The agreement  between the agency and the parent or guardian will state the respective  responsibilities of the parties for the care and control of the child.

This bill sets out substantially the  components of the Joint Commission on Health Care's COPN deregulation plan in  numerous enactments.  The first enactment sets forth goals and an outline for  the deregulation and will be effective in due course.  Each of the  three-deregulation phases are set out in separate, designated enactments.  The  goals of the deregulation are to (i) offer more choices to patients while  simultaneously providing consumers with better information about the value of  services in all settings; (ii) ensure that access to essential health care  services for all Virginians, particularly the indigent and the uninsured, is  preserved and improved, in so far as possible; (iii) provide strong quality  protections that correspond to service intensity and/or patient risk and apply  similarly across all health care settings; and (iv) support indigent care and  medical education costs at the academic health centers.     Phase I proposes to deregulate equipment purchases and introduction of new  services for computed tomographic (CT) scanning, lithotripsy, magnetic  resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic source imaging (MSI), positron emission  tomographic (PET) scanning, and all nuclear medicine imaging.  Phase II  proposes to deregulate equipment purchases and the introduction of new services  for cardiac catheterization, gamma knife surgery, and radiation therapy.  Phase  III proposes to deregulate ambulatory surgery centers, neonatal special care,  obstetric services, open-heart surgery, and organ transplantation services.     Simultaneously with the elimination of the COPN requirements, the providers of  the COPN-deregulated services will be required to comply with licensure  requirements promulgated and administered by the Board of Health, consistent  with appropriate existing, nationally recognized accreditation standards.  The  various COPN-deregulated providers will also be required to report claims data,  certain quality outcome information for selected high risk procedures, where  applicable, and annual financial information on indigent care.  Studies of the  effects of the deregulation and various related health care issues will be  required at each phase of the deregulation."

Morris, 236 V. 78  (1988))  granting immunity from civil damages to public school teachers  (elementary and secondary) when acting in good faith within their scope of  employment while supervising, caring for, or disciplining students and while  rendering health-related assistance during an emergency or upon authorization  of the child's parent or guardian, unless the acts or omissions were the  result of gross negligence or willful misconduct.   The bill extends immunity  to situations commonly occurring in schools where a teacher may be called  upon to give a student medication or to provide some other health-related  assistance, e.g., suctioning for a disabled ventilator-dependent child.     Applying a previously developed test for immunity, the Lentz court  held that the physical education teacher in the case was not liable, i.e.,  ""the employee is performing a vitally important public function as a school  teacher. The governmental entity employing the teacher, the local school  board, has official interest and direct involvement in the function of  student instruction and supervision, and it exercises control and direction  over the employee through the school principal.  Moreover, a teacher's  supervision and control of a physical education class, including the decision  of what equipment and attire is to be worn by the student participants,  clearly involves, at least in part, the exercise of judgment and discretion  by the teacher."""
